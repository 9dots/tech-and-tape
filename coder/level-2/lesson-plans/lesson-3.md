{% length '10 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students write code for a simple pixel bot image.

**Prep:** Hand out Lesson 3 | Warm-up.

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Ask students to solve the problem on [Lesson 3 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up].
2) As students attempt the problem, draw the problem on the whiteboard.
3) Code the solution to the problem as a whole class. Call on students at random to provide each next line of code. Each student should walk up to the board and draw the next symbol. With each new symbol, you should play the role of Navigator, moving the turtle. Call out the roles of Writer and Navigator to make them explicit. On occasion, pick a Reader and Stepper to walk up to the board to test the code starting from line one.

,,,

1) Students individually solve the problem on the worksheet.
3) If called on, students walk up to the board to write in (or read) the next line of code.

{% length '30 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students work in groups to write and read code to produce two pixel bot images.

**Prep:** Consider having paper bags for each group. Each paper bags contains the four roles (Writer, Navigator, Reader, Stepper).

{% table %}

1) Teacher breaks students into groups of four and randomly assigns roles for the Programming Team and the Computer Team. (Consider handing each group a paper bag with the four roles inside -- students reach into the bag and grab a role.) In this first round, groups either get [Lesson 3 | Worksheet 1][worksheet1] or [Lesson 3 | Worksheet 2][worksheet2] (alternate between groups). Bots should always help the Coders during the code writing phase of the activity.
2) Follow the Coders and Bots Protocol by having the Bot Team switch to a new group when it comes time to check the code. Make sure that the Coders fold back their paper to hide the provided pixel bot image before the Bots arrive (ensuring that the Bots are not biased in their reading). The Bots should test the code on an empty scratch paper grid.
Ask students, “What do you think the computer does when it cannot understand the code or the code forces the turtle to break the rules (go outside the grid)?”
Answer: An error!
If the Bots notice this happening, they should report the error to the programming team and tell them what line the error happened on.
3) After one round, pass out [Lesson 3 | Worksheet 3][worksheet3] or [Lesson 3 | Worksheet 4][worksheet4] to the groups (alternate again) and repeat the Coders and Bots Protocol.
4) In whole class mode, ask students to share out any disagreements they had in the write and read process. Use this as an occasion to firm up any misconceptions. Also use this time to introduce and define Elements and Actions (see vocabulary section above).

,,,

1) Students enact their Coders and Bots roles. They write code to create the pixel bot image.
2) The Bots switch to a new group to assess code.
If the Bots find an error, report it to the Coders and tell them what happened and the line number the error happened on.
3) Students repeat the above process with new coding challenges.
4) Students summarize and describe the disagreements they could not resolve.

{% length '5 minutes' %}

Time permitting, students individually fill out an exit ticket to check for understanding.

**Prep:** Hand out [Lesson 3 | Exit Ticket Worksheet][wrap-up]

{% table %}

1) Ask students to individually work on completing the [Lesson 3 | Exit Ticket Worksheet][wrap-up].
