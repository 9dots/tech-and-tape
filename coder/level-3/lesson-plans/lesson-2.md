<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students learn the different components of reading and writing code by exploring the roles of Coders & Bots (navigator, writer, stepper, actor).

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- Students will be able to read basic code.
- Students will be able to write basic code.
- Students will be able to enact the Coders & Bots roles of Navigator, Writer, Stepper, and Actor to write, read, and check code.

#### Explore: Write code (10 minutes)
>>“We have learned to read code that other people have written. Now we are going to explore writing code.”

- [ ] Pass out [Lesson 2 | Worksheet 1][worksheet1]
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students write code that produces the provided pixel bot image.
- [ ] **Model:** Code the solution on the whiteboard, voicing your code writing process along the way.
  - Plan which path to take, using your finger to trace out a path.
  - Write a line of code.
  - Number line of code.
  - Move magnetic pixelbot.
  - Repeat writing code and moving until the image is finished.

  <note type="tip" title="Tip: Narrate">
  - "I am writing a line of code."
  - "I am numbering this line of code."
  - "I am moving my pixelbot."
  - "I am navigating my pixelbot (up, down, left, right, to paint)."
  </note>

- [ ] **Model:** Read and step through your solution from beginning to end to check code.

>> “We will practice writing and reading code in pairs. We will act as Coders and Bots to solve pixelBots challenges.”

#### Explain/Elaborate: Coders & Bots (25 minutes)

- [ ] Pair students
  - If odd number of students, pair student with an assistant teacher.

- [ ] Pass out [Version 1][2-1] and [Version 2][2-2] of pixelBots challenges, coding paper, and grid paper.  
  - Pass out one [Version 3][2-3] for classes with odd number of pairs.
  - Pairs write their names on coding paper and number of worksheet. Ex: 2-1 or 2-3 or 2-3
  - Tell students to write code on coding paper and not the worksheets with the challenges.

  <note type="tip" title="Tip: Read Coders & Bots">
  Teacher must read [Coders & Bots][coders&bots] document throughly to understand this section of the lesson.
  </note>


- [ ] **Assign** Navigators
  >>“During the writing phase, everyone will be Coders helping to write code. One student in each pair raise your hand, you will be the Navigator"

- [ ] **Explain** Navigator
  >> "Navigators, you are responsible for the overall plan for the program. Guide the Writer and keep track of what your program is doing."
  - "Navigators, take the pixelBots challenges and pixelbot cutout and put them in front of you."

- [ ] **Assign** Writers
  >>"Partners, you are the writers. Take a pencil, coding paper, and grid paper."

- [ ] **Explain** Writer
  >>"Writers, you add code to your program. Pay attention to syntax."

- [ ] **Write Phase** of Coders & Bots
  - Coders team work together to write code for 1st challenge.
  - At the end of the writing phase, have students draw a star on the starting square of their challenge on the grid paper.

  <note type="tip" title="Tip: Draw Star">
  Coders must draw a star on one of the blank grids so the Bots know where to start.
  </note>


- [ ] **Switch Phase** of Coders & Bots
  - Pairs who coded 2-1 switch coding paper and grids with pairs who coded 2-2
  - If one worksheet 2-3 was passed out, switch among the three pairs of the different worksheets so Bots read for a challenge they have not coded.

  <note type="tip" title="Tip">
  Bots read code for a challenge different than the one they coded so they do not know the desired outcome.
  </note>

- [ ] Pass out grid paper.

<pagebreak/>

- [ ] **Assign** Stepper
  >>"Writers, raise your hands. You are now Steppers."

- [ ] **Explain** Stepper
  >>"Steppers step through the program one line at a time and read each line aloud. Keep your finger on the step you are reading."
  - "Steppers, take the coding paper and place it in front of you."


- [ ] **Explain** Actor
  >>"Actors listen carefully to each line of code the Stepper says aloud. Using the materials available, show what each line of code does."
  - "Actors, grab the pencil and grid paper. You will move and paint the outcome."

- [ ] **Read Phase** of Coders & Bots
  - Bots team work together to paint the outcome from the code they were given.

- [ ] **Check Phase** of Coders & Bots
  - Code and outcome is given back to original Coders Team.

  <note type="tip" title="Tip">
  If CT and BT have a disagreement, the Coders can redo the 1st challenge instead of moving onto the 2nd challenge.
  </note>

- [ ] Play Coders & Bots for 2nd challenge (if time allows)
  - Guide students through each phase.
  1. Write
  1. Switch
  1. Read
  1. Check

- [ ] **Introduce and define** Program (see definition above).
  - Explain how it connects to the code the students wrote.

  <note type="key" title="Key Take Away">
  Coders & Bots helps us practice writing and reading code while collaborating with other coders.
