<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students continue to solve pixelbots problems by playing Coders & Bots to write and read code.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

- Students will be able to perform the Coder & Bots roles of Navigator, Writer, Stepper, Actor.
- Students will be able to collaborate in pairs and in small groups to write and read code.
- Students will become more proficient at writing code.

###### Length: 45 minutes

1. **Engage:** Write Code Warm-up (5 minutes)
1. **Elaborate:** Read and write code with Coders & Bots(30 minutes)
1. **Evaluate:** Write code exit ticket (5 minutes)

<iconp src='/icons/vocab.png'>### Vocabulary</iconp>
- **Programming Element** - A command the computer understands.
- **Action** - An observable event that the code produces
- **Error** - The program fails to run because the computer cannot execute the code

- [ ] [Lesson 3 | Exit Ticket Worksheet][wrap-up]
- [ ] Coding paper
- [ ] Small pixel bot cutout for each student

- [ ] Pencils


</note>

#### Engage: Write Code Warm-up (10 minutes)

- [ ] Pass out [Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up] and pencils
- [ ] Students individually work to complete Warm-up.
- [ ] Code the solution together as a class on the board.
  - Call on students randomly to provide each line of code.
- [ ] Read and check program.
  - Ask for 2 volunteers to act as Bots: Stepper and Actor

#### Elaborate: Read and write code with Coders & Bots (30 minutes)

- [ ] **Review** Roles of Coders & Bots
  - Coders:
    1. Navigators
    1. Writers
  - Bots:
    1. Steppers
    1. Actors

- [ ] Pair students
- [ ] Pass out different versions and of pixelbots challenges, coding paper, and grids.
  - Pairs write their names on coding paper and number of worksheet.
  - Note: Use [Worksheet 1][w1], [Worksheet 2][w2], and [Worksheet 3][w3] for first round. Only pass out one Worksheet 3 if there is an odd number of pairs.

- [ ] **Assign** Coder roles
  >>“During the writing phase, everyone will be Coders.
  - "One student in each pair raise your hand, you will be the Navigator, take the pixelbots challenge worksheet and place it in front of you."
  - “Everyone with their hands down will be Writers, take the pencil and coding paper and place it in front of you.”

- [ ] **Write Phase** of Coders & Bots
  - Coders team work together to write code for 1st challenge.
  - At the end of the writing phase, have students draw a star on the starting square of their challenge on the grid paper.
  <note type="key" title="Key: Draw Star">
  Coders must draw a star on one of the blank grids so the Bots know where to start.
  </note>

- [ ] **Switch Phase** of Coders & Bots
  - Pairs who coded Worksheet 1, switch coding paper with pairs who coded Worksheet 2.
  - If one Worksheet 3 was passed out, switch among the three pairs of the different worksheets so Bots read for a challenge they have not coded.

- [ ] **Assign** Bot roles
  >>“We are now bots and we will read code and paint the outcome.”
  - “Writers are now steppers, take the coding paper and put it in front of you”
  - “Navigators are now actors, take the pencil and grid paper.”

- [ ] **Read Phase** of Coder & Bots
  - Bots team work together to paint the outcome from the code they were given.

- [ ] **Check Phase** of Coders & Bots
  - Code and outcome is given back to original Coders Team.

- [ ] Play another round of Coders & Bots if time allows.
  - Use [Worksheet 4][w4], [Worksheet 5][w5], and [Worksheet 6][w6].

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students talk about any disagreements they had in the write and read process.
  - Ask for 2-3 volunteers to share

- [ ] **Introduce and define** programming element and action
  - **Programming Element** - A command the computer understands.
  - **Action** - An observable event that the code produces
  - Explain how it connects to the code the students wrote.

#### Evaluate: Write code exit ticket (5 minutes)

- [ ] Pass out [Lesson 3 | Exit Ticket][wrap-up]
- [ ] Students individually work to complete exit ticket.
- [ ] If time allows, review answer after collecting exit ticket.
