<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 18 students learn to write loops on the pixelBot platform. Students use their ability to identify the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats to refactor sequences of code with loops.

## 1. Engage: Jumping Robot (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the jumping robot activity and ask for a volunteer to play the role of the jumping robot.
>> “We are going to play a game called jumping robot. In this game I will be a coder who will code a robot that can jump. The robot will follow the directions I have coded on the board. Would anyone like to volunteer to be the jumping robot?”

- [ ] **Show** the first two sequences of code. Then have the jumping robot act them out.

- [ ] **Explain** that in the next sequence of code you want the jumping robot to jump 50 times, but writing the direction 50 times will take too long.

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to try to think of a different way to tell the jumping robot to jump.

<iconp type='question'>What is another way we can make the robot jump 50 times without having to say jump 50 times?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** that instead of writing the jump direction 50 times it is possible to simply tell the jumping robot to repeat the jump command 50 times.

![engage-two](./images/engage-two.png)

- [ ] **Show** that the sequence of code with 50 jump commands is the same as the sequence of code that tells the robot to repeat the jump command 50 times.

## 2. Explore: Find the Pattern (10 min)
- [ ] **Show** pixelBot challenge number one and have the class help you write the code.
 >>“In this challenge we want to get our pixelBot to the square that the arrow is pointing to.”

<iconp type='question'>What directions should we code?</iconp>

![explore-one](./images/explore-one.png)

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to identify what is repeating in the code and the number of times it repeats?

<iconp type='question'>What direction is being repeated in this code?
How many times does it repeat?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** that just like in the robot game it is possible to repeat directions.
>>“Just like in our jumping robot game, we can tell our computer to repeat code instead of writing same line or lines of code over and over again.”

- [ ] **Demonstrate** how to repeat code using the loop block.
 >>“To tell our computer to repeat code we write it in a loop. First we select the code we want to repeat. Then we click the loop block and select the number of times we want the computer to repeat it.”

![explore-two](./images/explore-two.png)

- [ ] **Show** challenge number two and have the class help you write the code.
>>“In this challenge we want our pixelBot to paint a line of 3 squares.”

<iconp type='question'>What directions should we code?</iconp>

![explore-three](./images/explore-three.png)

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to identify the portion of the code that is repeating and the number of times it repeats on the board.

<iconp type='question'>What direction in this code can be repeated?
How many times does it repeat?</iconp>

- [ ] **Record** student responses by circling the core of the pattern and writing down the number of times it repeats.

- [ ] **Challenge** the class repeat the code the correct number of times with the loop block.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Students share what they did to repeat the code with a partner.

<iconp type='question'>What did you do to repeat the code?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share out what they did to repeat the code.

## 3. Explain: Repeat the Pattern (5 min)
- [ ] **Explain** the sequence of steps students should follow to write a loop.
	1. *Write* a sequence of code.
	2. *Find* the number of times the pattern repeats.
	3. *Repeat* the core of the pattern.

- [ ] **Model** how to follow the series of steps to write a loop using pixelBot challenge number three.

- *Write* a sequence of code.
>> “To solve this challenge my pixelBot needs to move right, paint, right, paint, right, paint.”

- *Find* the number of times the core of the pattern repeats.
>> “The core of the pattern is move right and paint and it repeats 3 times."

- *Repeat* the core of the pattern.
>>“Instead of coding move right and paint three times I can tell the computer to repeat those two lines of code 3 times. To repeat my code I will select the lines I want repeated and then click the loop block. The loop block tells the computer to repeat the code. Next I will select the number 3 to show that the code inside of the loop repeats 3 times. The last thing I will do is delete the code that I no longer need.”

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Have the class work together to solve pixelBot challenge number four.

- *Write* a sequence of code.
>> “To solve this challenge we have to paint two squares."

 <iconp type='question'>What should I code?</iconp>

- *Find* the number of times the core of the pattern repeats.
>>"Next we have to find the core of the pattern we coded."

<iconp type='question'>What is the core of the pattern we coded?</iconp>

- *Repeat* the core of the pattern.

	<iconp type='question'>How many times does the core of the pattern repeat?</iconp>
	<iconp type='answer'>The core of the pattern repeats 2 times.</iconp>
>>“Next we select the lines of code that make up the core of the pattern and click the loop block. Finally we write the number two in the blank space to show that the code will be repeated twice and delete the remaining blocks.”

## 4. Elaborate: pixelBot Loops (10 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students complete a series of coding challenges on pixelBot.
- [ ] **Monitor** the room for students in need of additional assistance.
- [ ] **Review** 2-3 challenges whole group.
- [ ] **Debrief** the lesson.
