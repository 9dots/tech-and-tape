<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 10 students solidify their understanding of debugging code by reviewing the compare, find, fix protocol. Students engage in hands-on practice using paper coding blocks and a pixelBots playlist.

## Engage: Paper Block Coding (8 min)
- [ ] **Motivate:** Students code in pairs using paper blocks to complete a challenge. (3 min)
	- [ ] Distribute paper coding blocks and display the coding challenge on slide 2.
	- [ ] Direct students to write code with a partner using the paper coding blocks. 

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share out their code. (2 min)
	- [ ] Invite a student to code his/her answer on your computer.
	- [ ] Run the code and have the class assist in debugging by sharing suggestions if necessary.

## Explore: Paper Block Debugging (3 min)
- [ ] **Partner Exploration:** Pairs attempt to debug paper block code. (3 min)
	- [ ] Display slide 3 and have students arrange their paper blocks to match the sequence on the board.
	- [ ] Display slide 4 and have each student step through the code using the token.
	- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Do we need to debug this code? Why?
	- [ ] Have partner pairs attempt to find the bug in the code by stepping through the sequence. After each step have students ask “Is this what I want the bot to do?”.

## Explain: Debugging Protocol (5 min)
-  [ ] **Discussion:** Students discuss what they did to debug the code. (2 min)
	- [ ] As students share their answers click to the matching animation in slide 5. 

<iconp type='question'>What was the first thing we did to solve this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We checked if the code worked.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>What did we do after we found out the code didn’t work?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We tried to find why it didn’t work.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>What did we do after we found where the bug was?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We made changes to the code to fix it.</iconp>

-  [ ] **Review** the debugging protocol. (3 min)
1. *Compare:*  “It sounds like the first thing we all did was compare what we wanted the code to do to what it actually did. This is how we learn if the code has a bug in it.
2. *Find:* “Next, we step through the code one line at a time to find where the bug is. After we step through a line we asked “Is this what we want the bot to do?”
3. *Fix:* “Once we find where the bug is we make changes to fix the code and we run the code to see if it works. If it does work we fixed the problem. If it doesn’t work we need to try to find and fix the problem again.”

## Elaborate: Independent Practice (17 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students work on a pixelBot playlist. (12 min)
- [ ] **Review** practice problems 1, 4, and 7 with the class. (5 min)
