## Explore: Mystery Robot (10 min)

<note type='key' title='Key Points'>
- Clues help us solve problems by eliminating possibilities.
- Some clues help us eliminate more possibilities than others.
</note>

In this activity students learn to use information in the form of clues to narrow down possibilities.  

<br/>

###### How to Play
**Goal:** Students must determine the identity of the mystery robot the teacher randomly selects from a deck of cards.
- [ ] Pass out a robot board and a dry erase marker to each student. 
- [ ] Select a robot from the deck of cards and read a clue.
- [ ] Model how to eliminate robots that do not fit the clue by crossing them out on slide 2. 
- [ ] Have students eliminate robots on their robot boards with a dry erase marker.
- [ ] Continue reading clues and having students eliminate robots until only one robot is left.

## Explain/Elaborate: Mystery Robot II (10 min)

<note type='key' title='Key Points'>
- Each question helps us learn something.
- Some questions help us eliminate more possibilities than others.
- Some of our guesses about the robot’s attributes may be wrong, but we can still learn something from being wrong.
</note>

In part II, students must ask questions about the robot’s attributes instead of receiving clues from the teacher..

###### How to Play
**Goal:** Students must determine the identity of a mystery robot the teacher randomly selects from a deck of cards.
- [ ] Select a robot from the deck of cards.
- [ ] Have students ask questions about the robot’s color, shape, size, and number.
- [ ] Have students eliminate robots that do not fit the information gained by asking the question.
- [ ] Continue answering students questions until the class identifies the mystery robot.

## Evaluate: Discussion (3 min)

<note type='key' title='Key Points'>
- Each guess we made and question we asked got the group closer to figuring out what the item was.
- It is ok not to get something right the first time. 
- We can learn just as much from being wrong as we can from being right.
</note>

Debrief the activity with a discussion.

<br/>

###### Discussion Questions
<iconp type='question'>How did it feel when you made a guess that was wrong?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Did we learn anything when we were wrong?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How was playing this game similar to the girl building her invention in *The Most Magnificent Thing*?</iconp>
