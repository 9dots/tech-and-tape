{% length '10 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students learn about the importance of giving clear and precise instructions by writing step-by-step instructions to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

**Materials:**
- Warm Up Handout
- Peanut Butter
- Jelly
- Bread
- Paper Plate
- Plastic Butter Knife

**Participation:**
Individual


{% table %}

1)  Have students respond to the prompt  below in 5 minutes.
 
  * Using the materials on the front table, write a set of step-by-step instructions for your teacher to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
 
2)  Ask for volunteers to share out their instructions in a step-by-step manner.  Follow each step as the student reads it. If a student says to put the peanut butter on the bread, put the jar of peanut butter on top of the bag of bread. The point is to show the importance of giving clear and precise instructions. Allow at least two different students to share.


3) **Key Points**
- Giving clear and precise instructions is important.
- Humans can often interpret the meaning and intentions behind a set instructions in ways computers can’t.
```
Example: A person can say “you open door” to another person and that person would be able to determine that they are being instructed to open a door. 
```
- In this class we will be writing clear and precise instructions that a computer can follow.

Students are introduced to sequencing by coding instructions to navigate their teacher through a maze.

**Prep:**
- Paper maze worksheet
- Rover cutout
- Unplugged platform
- Rover code blocks

**Participation**
Whole Group and Individual

{% table %}

1) Introduce the class to Rover the robot. 
Just like other computers, Rover can only follow clear and precise instructions in the form of code
Code is a set of instructions designed to be carried out by a computer.
Rover the robot can only follow three instructions.

- move 1 step
- turn left
- turn right



2) **Rover’s Instructions**

Explain Rover’s three instructions.
- move 1 step: makes Rover move one square in the direction it is facing (direction its headlights are pointing).
- turn left: makes Rover turn to its left
Have students point to their left. Then have them point to the direction Rover would turn if it was instructed to turn left. Explain that Rover’s left is different than ours when it is facing in a different direction than we are.

- turn right: makes Rover turn to its right
Have students point to their right. Then have them point to the direction Rover would turn if it was instructed to turn right. Emphasize that our left and right is different than Rover’s when it it facing in a different direction than we are.

3) **Check for Understanding**

Perform a check for understanding.
Show the first Check for Understanding slide and ask the class to point to the direction Rover would turn if it was asked to turn left.
Show the next slide and repeat the same prompt.

4) Have two student volunteers pass out robot cutouts and paper maze worksheets. Students should have their materials laid out in front of them like in the picture below.
![Navigate the Maze1](lesson-3/img/navigate-img1.JPG "Navigate the Maze1")

5) **Introduce the Maze Challenge**

Explain the goal and rules of the first challenge.
- We will try to navigate Rover to the yellow spot on the grid by working together as a class.
- We can navigate Rover by using the only  three instructions it can follow.
- We will sequence the code by writing the directions in the blank code blocks.

Describe the roles that students will play during the activity.

1. **Driver:** Proposes idea for new lines of code; group discusses
2. **Writer:** Writes the code.
3. **Stepper:** Keeps track of what the code has done
4. **Computer:** Executes the code from the beginning.

Explain who will play each of the roles during the activity.

- The **driver** will be played by volunteers in the class.
- The **writer** will be a volunteer that will stick code blocks on the board.
- The **stepper** will be a volunteer that moves Rover on the unplugged platform.
- The **computer** will be played by the whole class when we read the code out loud.

6) Ask the class for volunteers to play the role of the writer and stepper.

7) **Complete the Challenge:**

Have students place their Rover cutout at the starting square of their paper maze. 
Explain that the first step in completing this challenge is planning the path the Rover will take to get to the yellow spot.
Show that there are many paths that can be taken by displaying three different choices in the slides. 

8) Have the class vote on the path they will take and have them trace the path on their paper grid like in the picture below:
![Navigate the Maze2](lesson-3/img/navigate-img2.JPG "Navigate the Maze2")

9) Ask the class what the first instruction should be. 
```
Highlight that this is a an example of the class playing the role of the driver.
```

10) Once the class has settled on an instruction, have the writer place a code block on the board and have the stepper move Rover in response to the instruction. 
11) Instruct students to write the instruction into the first blank code block on their worksheet and to move their Rover cutout on their paper maze. Continue this process each time an instruction is chosen by the class.

- Inform the class that you will be cold calling students for instructions after a volunteer shares the second instruction for Rover.

12) After the volunteer shares the second instruction for Rover, have the writer place the second code block on the board and have the stepper move Rover in response to the instruction.

13) Cold call different students for the rest of the sequence. 

14) When the sequence is complete, have the stepper place Rover back at the starting square. Have the class read the code in unison and have the stepper move Rover as each block of code is read to check if the code is correct.  
```
Highlight that this is an example of the class playing the role of the computer.
```
15) **Plan, Code, Validate Process**

Describe the process the class just used to plan, write, and check the code.

1. Plan: Explain that the class first planned how to complete the challenge by choosing a path and tracing it out on the paper grid.
2. Code: Explain that the class coded the path one step at a time.
3. Validate: Explain that the word validate means to check if something is correct or does what it is intended to do. In this process the class validated the code by reading the code starting at the beginning to see if it did what it was intended to do (get Rover to the yellow spot).

16) **Maze 2** 

Change the position of Rover and the yellow spot on the grid to match maze two. Explain that in this challenge students will work independently to get Rover to the yellow spot by writing their own code using the paper maze and Rover cutout.

- Display the plan, code, validate process on the board and remind students that they should use this process to complete the challenge.
- Inform students that they will have 5 minutes to complete the challenge and that you will call on volunteers to share their code. 

17) Allow students to begin planning and writing their code.

18) After 5 minutes have passed, have volunteers share out their code and act it out as they read it.
