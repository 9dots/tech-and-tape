Practice writing function calls with arguments to maneuver the pixel bot.

**Prep:** Hand out the [Lesson 9 | Unplugged Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up].

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Ask students to write the code to maneuver the squirrel to the nut in the [Lesson 9 | Unplugged Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up]. Consider reminding students of the proper JavaScript syntax (see Elements on the worksheet).
2) Draw the example on the whiteboard and code the solution with the students, randomly calling on one student at a time to provide each next line of code.

,,,

1) Students individually fill out the Warm-up worksheet.
2) If called on, students provide the next line of code.

{% endtable %}

{% header title='Help the Squirrel', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '15 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students write code in JavaScript on the getCoding.io platform to help the squirrel gather the acorns. Students are practicing simple sequences with arguments.

**Prep:** Students should have their own computers.

{% table %}

1) Ask students to browse to getcoding.io and start moving through the challenges in Passing Arguments: Squirrel Climber. Explain to the students that now the squirrel movements can take one argument - the number of squares to move.
2) When students get stuck, we suggest using the Read, Write, and Debug protocols to support students. Ask students to imagine being on the Coder team from the group activities. They should try to play the roles of the writer and navigator. Then, ask students to imagine being a Bot to understand how the computer reads the code.

1) Students start solving the challenges in the Space Ranger activities.

{% header title='Introducing strings', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '5 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Gather students and introduce the concept of strings.

**Prep:**
  - Set up projector to show Passing Arguments: Magic Words on getcoding.io
  - Write examples of all of the function calls that students have used with arguments on the whiteboard

```js
From pixelbots.io:
up(2)
down(3)
left(2)
right(4)

From getcoding.io:
move(4)
```

{% table %}

1) Show students the function calls on the whiteboard. Ask students what pattern they notice about the arguments they have been using.

Answer: All of the arguments up until this point have been numbers.

2) Show students Passing Arguments: Magic Words. Ask students what kind of argument is needed to cast a spell in the game.

Answer: A word

3) Explain that in programming text is a different type of data called a **string**. To let the computer know that a value is a string, it needs to be put inside quotation marks.

Ex. `cast('fire')`

4) As a class do the first puzzle of Passing Arguments: Magic Words. Make sure to draw attention to the quotation marks that go around the string.

{% length '15 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students continue writing code in JavaScript on the getCoding.io platform for the Passing Arguments: Magic Words. Remind them that in this version, in addition to opening the gates, whenever there is a fire or ice wall, they need to cast a spell of the opposite element.

**Prep:** None

1) Ask students to resume coding individually.
