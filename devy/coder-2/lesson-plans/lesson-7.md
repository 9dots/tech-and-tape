Students solve a puzzle in a large pixelbot grid.

**Prep:**

- Draw the Pixel Bot image from [Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet][warm-up] on the whiteboard
- Distribute [Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet][warm-up]

{% table %}

1) **Individual work:** Ask students to write code to create the image from [Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet][warm-up].
2) Randomly call on one student at a time to provide each next line of code.
3) Discuss what made this particular picture difficult or frustrating to code.

	Possible answer: It required a lot of code because of the size of the grid.
,,,

1) Students individually fill out the [Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet][warm-up]
2) If called on, students provide the next line of code.
3) Students raise their hands to provide an answer.

{% header title='Golf swing and drill bits', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '20 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Explore golf swing and drill bit analogies that help students arrive at concept of parameters/arguments.

**Prep:** Distribute [Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1-1][worksheet1-1]

{% table %}

1) **Individual work:** Ask students to fill out [Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1-1][worksheet1-1].
2) As a whole class, pool students' ideas.
3) **Individual work:** Hand out [Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1-2][worksheet1-2] and ask students to give it a try.
4) Discuss how to write the proper syntax for the golf and drill bit programs. Write a few examples of the syntax on the board and ask students to predict how far the ball would go or how big the hole would be.
5) **Individual work:** Hand out the next [Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1-3][worksheet1-3] Cont'd and ask students to map these ideas over to pixel bot.
6) Discuss students' ideas for Question 6.
  Answer: The process is exactly the same (the golf swing never changes; the drill and the drill motion never change), but we can customize the output by changing the inputs (golf club, drill bit).
,,,

1) Students fill out Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1-1.
2) Students share ideas.
3) Students fill out [Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1-2][worksheet1-2].
4) Students predict the teacher's code.
5) Students fill out next part of [Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1-3][worksheet1-3].
6) Students raise their hands to provide answers

{% header title='Arguments', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '5 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Explain how to use arguments through observation.

**Prep:** None

{% table %}

1) Point students back to the problem on the whiteboard from Lesson 1 | Warm-up worksheet.
2) Tell students that the elements can use an argument. An argument is extra information to customize the output of a function. The argument goes in between the parenthesis that follow the name of the function.

Example: `up( 5 )`

3) Ask students to say once again what the argument will do in the case of the movements?

Answer: The number controls how many spaces to move in that direction.

4) Add `paint('blue')`
5) Ask students what they think the argument will do in the case of the paint icon?

  Answer: the argument controls what color the turtle will paint
6) Ask students how changing the color next to the icon relates to changing clubs in the golf swing?
  Answer: In both examples, the action is the same (swing the golf club, paint the square) but the input can be changed to customize the output.
7) Solve the warm up problem while narrating the steps out loud.

,,,

3) Students raise their hand to provide an answer.
5) Students raise their hand to provide an answer.
6) Students raise their hand to provide an answer.
7) Students observe as the teacher demonstrates how to solve the problem using arguments.
