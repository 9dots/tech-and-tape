# PixelBots
 
PixelBots: Emoji teaches students basic JavaScript using pixelBots.io. In pixelBots.io students code a bot to move and paint squares on a grid to form a picture. They are introduced to core coding concepts: sequences, calling functions, passing arguments, and for loops. During this course students will design their own pixel emoji using the design thinking process and prototype their emoji. Students will then code a bot to paint their pixel emoji. At the end of the course, students share their work with peers and mentors at a culminating showcase.
