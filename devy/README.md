Coding is so much more than a language--it's a tool. A tool for creating video games, music, and art. A tool for changing the world.

We believe that all students should be equipped with the coding skills they need to be creators and active citizens in the new digital world, not just consumers. â€‹

Our coding curriculum gives your educators the tools they need to empower students to be digital developers, artists and citizens.

Our lessons incorporate unplugged and online activities that build connections between coding concepts and apply them to projects. Along with hard skills in coding, students learn the processes and mindsets of a computer programmer. Students learn to approach failure as an opportunity, collaborate with peers on writing and reviewing code, and tap into their own creativity without reservations.
