# PixelBots Pixel Art
Pixel Art is an extension of the PixelBot Emoji series. Students learn to use to use a design process to turn their sketches into pixel art using code. During the course students design an assortment of pixel art ranging from cartoon characters to personalized crests. The 6 lesson series culminates with a project showcase.

## Purpose
Empower students to use computational thinking practices to analyze problems, build solutions, and be creative.


## Big Goals
  1. Students will apply core computational thinking concepts (algorithms, pattern recognition, control, and abstraction) to problem solving.
  1. Students will be fluent in reading, writing, and debugging code.


## Understandings
  1. Programs are built iteratively through a cycle of planning, writing, and checking.
  1. Complexity in programs can be hidden through pattern identification.
  1. When code doesn’t work the way we want it to, we fearlessly, creatively, and systematically debug it.


## Essential questions
  1. What is the process of writing a program?
  1. How can I simplify a program?
  1. How can I make my program shareable?
  1. When your program doesn’t do what you expected, how do you fix it?


## Lessons

Title | Description | Objective
---|---| ---
[Lesson 01: Pixel Art][1] | Students learn how to design pixel art. Students use paper grids to design and prototype creations of their own. The lesson begins with an inclusion game that allows students to use their imagination to generate new ways to use an object. The class then uses the paper grids to design their creations before coding them on the PixelBots platform. The lesson closes with a debrief in which students discuss the challenges they encountered and how they tried to work through them. | I can design codeable pixel art.
[Lesson 02: Pixel Artists][2] | Students are introduced to a strategy for planning code. Students design pixel art on paper grids and use annotations to break the image apart into smaller, codeable pieces. Students use the resulting images to plan the order they will code them in. The lesson closes with a debrief in which students discuss the challenges they encountered and how they tried to work through them. | I can create a plan to code my pixel art.
[Lesson 03: Coding Art][3] | Students learn a new strategy to enact their coding plan. Students design a piece of pixel art on paper, break it apart to plan a course of action, and transfer their plan to the PixelBots editor in the form of comments before writing their code. The lesson closes with a debrief in which students discuss the challenges they encountered and how they tried to work through them. | I can code my pixel art.
[Lesson 04: Feedback][4] | Students practice giving and receiving feedback on their pixel art code. Students design and code a new pixel art image. The group then reviews each other’s creations and provides written feedback. The lesson closes with a reflection discussion on the experience of giving and receiving feedback. | I can give and receive feedback on pixel art code.
[Lesson 05: Revise][5] | Students practice taking feedback and revising their code. Students design and code a crest that represents who they are. The group then follows the same feedback process from Lesson 4 before revising their code based on the feedback that is given. The pixel art project from this lesson is used in the project showcase in Lesson 6. | I can revise my code based on feedback from my peers.
[Lesson 06: Showcase][6] |  Students showcase their pixel art project from Lesson 5. Student use the first part of the lesson to complete their revisions and prepare to present their art to the group. The class then breaks off into small groups of 4-5 students with 1 instructor to share their pixel art. The lesson concludes with a gallery walk in which students share positive praise for each using “praise post-its”. | I can showcase my pixel art.
