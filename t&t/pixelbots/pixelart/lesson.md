<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Lesson 16 is a continuation of Lesson 15 as students gain comfort with coding more complex target grids. This lesson serves to provide more practice for coding programs with code inside and outside of loops. Students will be pushed to explain their reasoning for when they do and don’t use loops. They will also be asked to decompose each grid into distinct parts.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can write a program that contains code outside of a loop.
- I can share out my reasoning for chunking code.

## 1. Engage: Unpacking (8 mins)
**Location:** Rug
- [ ] **Define** “decompose” as *to break something apart into smaller pieces.*
>>“Coders, last week you learned all about how to decompose a shape into chunks that can be looped, and chunks that should not be put in loops. Decompose is a word that simply means to break something apart into smaller pieces. Let’s practice decomposing on PixelBots!”

<note type='tip'>
If possible, make the connection between math and coding by using an example for decomposing. For example, the slideshow decomposes the number 13 into 10 and 3. (Connection to Math CCSS 1.NBT.2B.)
</note>

- [ ] **Define** different shapes for PixelBot challenges to norm class language.
>>“When you look at shapes, be specific about what you mean! One block by itself is a “dot”. Four blocks together in a square shape is a “square”. And two or more blocks in a row is a “rectangle”.

- [ ] **Reveal** sample PixelBots grids to students to practice decomposing grids into separate chunks.
>>“Remember that we want to use loops for parts of the grid that show a pattern and are close together. We want to use regular code outside of a loop for anything outside of a pattern. While I show you these pictures, I want you to think, “Which part of the grid should we use a loop for?”

- [ ] **Model** how to decompose the first PixelBots grid for students. Then have them decompose the other grids.
>> “When I look at the first grid, I’m going to look for shapes. I don’t really see any that might help me! But I do see two blue dots in a straight line, and then a green dot up on the right by itself. I’m thinking I might use a loop to write, step, step, paint twice.” (Point to the grid to show students)


<note type='tip'>
Answers for sample PixelBots grids:

1. We should use a loop for the first two blue dots, because the pattern is step, step, paint blue.
1. We should use a loop for the purple rectangle because the pattern is step, paint purple.
1. We should use a loop for the black rectangle, because the pattern is step, paint black.
1. We should use a loop for the black square because the pattern is paint black, step, turn right.

<br/>

<iconp type='question'>Do you see any shapes in the grid? What colors are they?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Push students to clearly state the shape. For example, “I see a purple line.”</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which part of the grid should we use a loop for? How do you know?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Push students to clearly state the pattern that needs a loop. For example, “The pattern is step, turn right, paint.” </iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Coders, great job reviewing last week’s skill. Let’s keep working on it! Our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

<br/>
- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One as a class. Use the blank slide following the challenge to write down student observations.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Where do you think we can use a loop? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which part will be outside of a loop? Why?</iconp>
<br/>

Follow up questions:
<br/>

For identifying the challenge coders need to complete
<iconp type='question'>What is our job as coders this time? How do you know?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<br/>

For understanding the components of the grid
<iconp type='question'>Is there a line limit? What is it?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
<br/>

For identifying the loop-able and non-loop-able components
<iconp type='question'>What shapes do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see a pattern? Where?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
Sample answers:

- There is no code this time. We need to write code.
- The PixelBot is supposed to paint two blue and one green dots.
- The line limit is nine lines.
- The PixelBot is at the bottom facing right.
- There is a pattern with the two blue dots and one green dot.
- We can use a loop for the blue dots and will not use a loop for the green dots.
</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (4 mins)
**Location:** Rug/Desks
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to step through the code in Challenge One.
>>“Today I want you to try Challenge One based on what we learned while unpacking as a class. Use what you know about loops to help you.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to solve Challenge One at computers.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students who can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity. Look for students who are successfully completing the code outside the loop once and completing the loop the correct number of times.

## 3. Explain:  Code Outside of Loops (10 mins)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Explain** to students how to find patterns and outliers in code.
>>“Coders, just like in Challenge One, you are going to look for what to loop and what not to loop in your code: “ (have students read from the slide)

- *Loops:* Look for repeating patterns in the goal grid.
- *Code outside of loops:* Look for different colors and blocks that aren’t part of the repeating pattern

- [ ] **Introduce** Challenge Two
>>“The challenges we work on today will be pretty similar to our first! Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code.”

<note type='tip'>
Sample answers:

- There is no code this time. We need to write code.
- The PixelBot is supposed to paint four dots green and one dot orange.
- The line limit is eleven lines.
- The PixelBot is at the bottom facing up.
- We can use a loop for the square and will not use a loop for the one dot by itself outside of the square.
</note>

<br/>

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.
<iconp type='question'>Which part of this challenge will we write with a loop? Which part will we write without a loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We are going to paint the four green dots with a loop. Then, we’ll keep going and paint the one separate orange dot not in a loop.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Share Out and Model:** Have student share out their answers to the question below. Test their ideas by adding code in the editor clicking run. Continue asking the question and testing out their ideas until the group comes up with a solution to Challenge Two.

<iconp type='question'>Which part should we start with first? The loop or the code outside of the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We should start with a loop.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How should we code the part that we want looped?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We should write paint, step, turn left four times.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How should we code the part that is not looped?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We should write step, step, paint once.</iconp>
<br/>


## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (18 mins)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance. If time permits, review challenges 4 and 5 with students by allowing them to share their coding process.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot bonus challenges.
<note type='tip'>
As students gain comfort with the skill, consider pulling a small group of students who need extra support. Use this time to provide extra guidance and solidify understanding.
</note>
<br/>

## 5. Evaluate: Debrief (5 mins)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Discuss** the question below as a class.
<iconp type='question'>How did you feel while coding today and why?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What did you learn today?</iconp>
<br/>
