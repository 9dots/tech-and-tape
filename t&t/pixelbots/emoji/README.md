# PixelBots Emoji
PixelBots Emoji teaches students block coding using PixelBots.io. In PixelBots.io students code a bot to move and paint squares on a grid to form a picture. They are introduced to core coding concepts: sequences and loops. During this course students will design their own emoji using the design thinking process and prototype their emoji. Students will then code a bot to paint their emoji. At the end of the course, students share their work with peers and mentors at a culminating showcase.  

## Purpose
Empower students to use computational thinking practices to analyze problems, build solutions, and be creative.


## Big Goals
  1. Students will apply core computational thinking concepts (algorithms, pattern recognition, control, and abstraction) to problem solving.
  1. Students will be fluent in reading, writing, and debugging code.


## Understandings
  1. Programs are built iteratively through a cycle of planning, writing, and checking.
  1. When code doesn’t work the way we want it to, we fearlessly, creatively, and systematically debug it.


## Essential questions
  1. What is the process of writing a program?
  1. When your program doesn’t do what you expected, how do you fix it?


## Lessons

Title | Description | Objective
---|---| ---
[Lesson 01: Digital Literacy][1] | Students get familiar with navigating and using their computer, as well as the PixelBots interface. During this lesson, set expectations for using the computers. | I can log into and navigate my computer. I can navigate to a website. I can use a trackpad. I can navigate and use the PixelBots editor.
[Lesson 02: Sequences][2] | Students learn the fundamental coding concept of sequencing to program a bot to paint a given picture on PixelBots.io. Using forward, turnRight, turnLeft, and paint blocks, students will write sequential lines of code to move the bot and to paint. | I can write code in a sequence on PixelBots. I can navigate and use the PixelBots editor to write programs using icons. I can use specific numbers and colors with the forward and paint code blocks to paint an image in PixelBots.
[Lesson 03: Loops][3] | Students are introduced to loops in block coding on PixelBots.io. Students will use loops for repetitive sequences of code. | I can rewrite a repeating sequence with a loop.
[Lesson 04: Debugging][4] | Students learn and apply the debugging protocol to a playlist of PixelBot Debugging Challenges. They will complete a series of longer debugging challenges to prepare them to tackle bugs in their emoji project. | I can use the debugging protocol to debug my code.
[Lesson 05: Designing Emojis][5] | Students learn and use the design thinking process to design an emoji in PixelBots that they think a friend or family member will like. Students will learn to decompose their emoji into features. | I can create a prototype on PixelBots using the design thinking process. I can decompose my prototype into features and write a comment on PixelBots for each feature.
[Lesson 06: Review Loops & Project Time][6] |  Students will review loops and start coding their Emoji Projects using all the coding concepts learned in previous lessons: sequence and loops. | I can code my project using sequences and loops.
[Lesson 07: Project Time Continued][7] |  Students will continue to code their Emoji Projects using all the coding concepts learned in previous lessons: sequence and loops. | I can code my project using sequences and loops.  
[Lesson 08: Project Time Continued][8] | Students will continue to code their Emoji Projects using all the coding concepts learned in previous lessons: sequence and loops. |  I can code my project using sequences and loops.
[Lesson 09: Showcase Prep][9] | Students prepare to showcase their Emoji Projects by finishing up their project and writing a letter to a future coder that reflects on their process of designing, building, and debugging their code. |  I can write a letter that reflects on the process of designing, building, and debugging my code. I can finish coding my features of my emoji.
[Lesson 10: Showcase][10] | Students will share their projects in a showcase. | I can explain and share my project with family, friends, and mentors.
