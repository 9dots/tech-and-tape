<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students learn and use the design thinking process to design an emoji in PixelBots that they think a friend or family member will like. In preparation of coding a bot to paint their emoji in the next lessons, students will decompose their emoji into features. Then students continue to build their debugging skills by using debugging strategies to tackle a series of PixelBots challenges.

#### 1. Engage: Emoji Story (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Motivate:** Introduce the Design Thinking Process and how students will use this process to design an emoji that is meaningful for a friend or a family member. Pass out Design Thinking Handout.
  >>“Today you will begin your project by designing an emoji! All great creations go through a planning process and so you will learn and use the design thinking process to help you create an emoji. I have a story told by emojis of today’s lesson. To help motivate your design, you will create an emoji for a friend or a family member. Then ideas will be brainstormed, one of those ideas will turn into a design, that is then coded on the computer, and once it is all programmed you will have an emoji!”


#### 2. Explain/Explore: Design Thinking (40 minutes)

**EMPATHIZE:** (7 minutes) Students will plan out their project using the Design Thinking process. Each step of the way you should model the process before having students complete that step on their own.

- [ ] **Model:** Think of a person to create an emoji for and fill out Empathize section of worksheet on the whiteboard while thinking aloud.
 >>“When creating a design, I first need to decide who I am creating it for and what they would want out of the design. What things do they like? What are their interests and needs?”
  - "I am creating an emoji for my dad."
  - "My dad likes reading, math and basketball."
  - "What I want to convey in this emoji might be my dad’s love for reading, how he always thinks about math, and the feeling of watching his favorite basketball team winning"

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Empathize section.
 >>“Your turn. Choose someone you are going to create your emoji for. What do they like? What are their interests?”


**IDEATE:** (8 minutes) Students will brainstorm all their possible ideas for an emoji that matches the person they empathized with in the previous step.

- [ ] **Model:** Create as many ideas as you can for emojis and sketches in the Ideate section of worksheet.
  >>“Since my dad likes to read, he might want to be able to text me a  book emoji. Since he likes math he might want to be able send a face with math symbols.Some other emojis he might like are an excited face, a basketball...”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Ideate section and sketch what their emoji might look like.
  >>“Your turn. List as many emoji ideas as you can based on the person you are designing the emoji for.”

**PROTOTYPE:** (15 minutes) Students will create a prototype of their emoji on PixelBots.

- [ ] **Model:** Show the prototype of math face emoji on PixelBots (code: OE3K4). Demonstrate using the paint and eraser tool on PixelBots to paint their prototype.
  >>“I decided for this project to create the math face emoji. Here is what my prototype looks like. A prototype is your first model, or draft, of what you will create. Watch as I show you how to create your own prototype on PixelBots.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students prototype their favorite pixel emoji idea on [Emoji | Project][project] challenge on PixelBots. Guide students how to get to the emoji prototype challenge (code: NN53T).
  >>“Your turn. Choose which of your emojis you will design for your project and create your own prototype on pixelBots.”

**DECOMPOSITION:** (10 minutes) Students will break down the main parts of their prototype so that they are ready to code their project in purposeful parts.

- [ ] **Model:** Go through Decomposing Art slide and show how to use comments in pixelBots to decompose emoji.
  >>“Before I jump into coding my emoji, I need to break it into simpler parts. This is called decomposition. Follow along as I decompose the parts of my math face emoji. Your decomposed emoji will be the plan of how you code your emoji in pixelBots.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students decompose their emoji by writing comments in pixelBots.
  >>“Your turn. Decompose your emoji prototype and create a comment for each of the decomposed parts of your emoji.”

- [ ] **Pair Share:**  In pairs, students share their prototype and give one positive comment about their partners emoji.
 >>“Coders like to share their projects and get input from other coders. Turn to your table partner and share who you are designing your emoji for and show them your prototype. Partners, tell each other one thing you like about their emoji. Be specific.”


#### 3. Elaborate: Debugging Challenges (15 minutes)

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students continue to build their debugging skills through completing debugging challenges on [Emoji | Debug playlist (Code: Q24P4)][playlist].
  >>“Before you jump straight into coding your emoji, we’re are going to take some time to build our debugging skills. Debugging is an important skill to have when starting a project. Ask any coder, and they’ll tell you all great projects have bugs, it’s part of the process. As you work on debugging challenges, I will come around to check your prototypes.”


#### 4. Evaluate: Prototypes

- [ ] **Evaluate:**  As students complete debugging challenges, circulate and check in with each student on their completed emoji prototype with comments of how they decomposed their project.
