Students will start coding their Emoji Projects using all the coding concepts learned in previous lessons: sequence, arguments, and loops.



<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can code my project using sequencing, arguments, and loops.
- I can code at least two features of my emoji.

#### 1. Engage: Debug & Vocab (10 minutes)

 - [ ] **Challenge:** Students do [Emoji | Debug | Heart challenge][debug] on pixelbots.io. (code:GD9QD)
  >>“Today you will start your Emoji Project, but before you jump straight into coding your emoji, we are going to take some time to build our debugging skills. You have 5 minutes to find and fix as many bugs as you can in these challenges.”

- [ ] **Discuss:** Facilitate a class discussion about the Heart Emoji debugging challenge.
  <iconp type='question'>What strategies did you use to find the bugs?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What bugs did you find in the Heart Emoji? How did you fix them?</iconp>

  >>“As you code your project today, some helpful tips and tricks are to run and check your program regularly. You can debug as you code each part of your project.”

- [ ] **Connecting Prior Knowledge:** Connect vocabulary words with Heart Emoji code. Call students up to the board to circle the part of the program that matches the given vocabulary word in the program.

  <iconp type='question'>Circle a few coding blocks in this program.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Circle the arguments.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Define argument.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Circle a comment.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Define comment.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Circle 2 Loops.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How do we know this is a loop?</iconp>

  >>“You have learned so much during this class: sequencing, arguments, design thinking, and loops. Use all the knowledge you learned and have fun coding your Emoji.”



#### 2. Explore/Explain: ToDo List (7 minutes)

- [ ] **Contrasting Cases:** Compare example and nonexample of todo lists.
  <iconp type='question'>Which of these two todo lists is more useful?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The one on the right.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What makes a todo list useful?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Each feature is listed on a separate line.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Each item is specific.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Each item is a single color.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>There are check boxes so I can check off a feature when I am done.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Todo list is dated.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Says the name of the project the todo list is for.</iconp>

- [ ] **Model:** Create a todo list for math eyed emoji. Assess progress on project by looking at code.
  >>“So far I have coded the pi and division eye. I still need to code the face, mouth, and outline.”
  *Create todo list (click through to show each feature on slide.*
 "I am going to list the features I still need to code. I want to code the mouth and outline today, and if I have time I will code the face.”

- [ ] **Planning:** Students assess progress on their pixel emoji and create a todo list in their coding journal.

#### 3. Elaborate: Project Time (43 minutes)

- [ ] **Explore:** Students learn about using the moveTo block to move their bot to a specific square on the grid using coordinates. Students should use moveTo block in their projects to move from one feature to the next. Over the projector show the gif of the bot moving using the moveTo blocks.

  <iconp type='question'>What is different about the way the bot is moving? What is the new block?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The bot can move to a specific spot in one line of code using the new block.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What are the arguments used in the new function call? What do they mean?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The arguments are the x and y coordinates of a square on the grid. </iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the coordinate of this bottom left corner? Coordinate for the center?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Bottom left -  (0,0) and center - (6,6)</iconp>

  >>“This new block is called moveTo, we can code the bot to move to a new square on the grid using two numbers. Use the moveTo block to move from one feature of your emoji to the other.”

- [ ] **Project:** Students have the rest of the lesson to work on their final project, coding one feature of their emoji at a time and checking it off their to do list.

- [ ] **Evaluate:** Circulate and check students progress on Emoji. Students should have at least two features of their Emoji project completed.
