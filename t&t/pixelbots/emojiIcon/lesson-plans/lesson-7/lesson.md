#### 1. Engage: ToDo List (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Planning:** Students assess progress on their pixel emoji and create a todo list in their coding journal.
  >>“Today you will be finishing you emoji project. Let’s start our day by assessing our current progress on our emoji project and then write out a Todo List.”



#### 2. Elaborate: Project Time (55 minutes)

- [ ] **Project:** Students have the rest of the time to work on their final project, coding one feature of their emoji at a time and checking it off their todo list.

- [ ] **Circulate:** Check in with each student and view their’ progress. Suggest using loops and moveTo function to increasing line efficiency.

- [ ] **Evaluate:** Circulate and check in with students.


#### 3. Showcase: Emoji Projects

- [ ] **Showcase:** Students open their final emoji project on their computer. Split the class in half. Half will view their peers emojis, while the other half stays at their computer to show their emoji/code and answer any questions. Then the groups switch.
