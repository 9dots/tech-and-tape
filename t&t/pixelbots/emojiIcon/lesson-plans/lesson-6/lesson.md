#### 1. Engage: ToDo List (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Planning:** Students assess progress on their pixel emoji and create a todo list in their coding journal.
  >> “Today you will have the full time to work on your emoji project. Before we jump right in, let’s assess our current progress on our emoji project and write out a Todo List. By the end of today your emoji should be more than halfway done.”


#### 2. Elaborate: Project Time (55 minutes)

- [ ] **Project:** Students have the rest of the time to work on their final project, coding one feature of their emoji at a time and checking it off their todo list.

- [ ] **Circulate:** Check in with each student and view their’ progress. Suggest using loops and moveTo block to increasing line efficiency.

- [ ] **Evaluate:** Circulate and check students progress on Emoji. Students should be more than halfway done with their emoji.
