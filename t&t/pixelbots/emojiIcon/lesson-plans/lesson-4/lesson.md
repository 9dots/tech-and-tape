#### 1. Engage: Share Prototypes (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Whip Around:** Students open their Emoji Prototypes on pixelBots.io and turn their computers to face the class. Call on students to share their emoji using 1 or 2 words. Every student should share.
 >>"Today you will code your pixel emojis! Before we start, let’s take a quick look at everyone’s emoji prototype. Open your emoji prototype and think of 1-2 words you would use to describe your project. When you’re ready to share, turn your computer to face the class."

 - *Whip around the class and then:*

 >>“These emojis are bigger than any challenge we’ve coded! And the program you will write will have more lines of code as well. Today you will learn a new concept that will be a powerful tool in coding your emoji.”


#### 2. Explore: Repeating Code (15 minutes)

- [ ] **Challenge:** Students are first introduced to loops in a debugging challenge, [Emoji | L4 (code:Q545K )][playlist]. Without any direct instruction, give students three minutes to debug the program.
  >>“I have a debugging challenge for you! You will see code that looks different than the last time we coded in PixelBots. I challenge you to figure out what is happening in the code. You have three minutes to debug the code. I want you to focus on stepping through the new coding block.”

- [ ] **Discuss:** Facilitate a class discussion about the debugging challenge.

  <iconp type='question'>What is new in this challenge? How does it change how the code is read?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>New programming element</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Lines of code can be repeated. </iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which lines did the bugs occur on and how did you try to fix them?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Line 3 - change 3 to 4. Code will now repeat 4 times. </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Line 6/7 - add “paint teal” after the loop</iconp>

  >>“The code you debugged has a loop and debugging loops can be challenging, but loops are very useful. We are going to see why they are useful through these next two challenges. Pay attention to how loops are written, what is being repeated, and how many times it repeats.”

- [ ] **Contrasting Cases:** Students complete and compare Explore 1 and Explore 2 challenges from [Emoji | L4 playlist (code:Q545K )][playlist] to come up with their own definition of loop. Students should notice that Challenge Explore 1 and Explore 2 paint the same picture, but 2 coded with a loop and is coded for them. After students have completed 1 & 2, discuss the challenges.

  <iconp type='question'>What do you notice about challenges 1 & 2?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The same picture is painted.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Challenge 2 code uses less lines of code than 1.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The bot moves in a pattern: paint, forward paint, forward … </iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Challenge 2 uses a coding concept that we call a loop.  What chunk of code is the loop? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Lines 4 -7</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code is being repeated? And how many times is it repeated?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>paint blue, forward, this is repeated 6 times</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How would you define loops?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Call on multiple students to give their definitions. Then on the board, write class’ definition of loops.</iconp>


#### 3. Explain: Loops (13 minutes)

- [ ] **Define:** Give students the definition of loops and ask them to compare it to their definition.
 >>“Here is how computer scientists define loops: a sequence of instructions that is repeated a set number of times.”

 <iconp type='question'>How did we do? Does our definition match up to their definition?</iconp>
 <iconp type='answer'>Allow students to discuss this. They may need help understanding the words in the definition. They should be allowed to add to or modify their definition.</iconp>

- [ ] **Model:** Reinforce loops by modeling and doing Explore 5 over the projector. Code the 4 pink corners in the challenge and ask students to give you the next line of the code to paint the cyan line.
  >>“Let’s practice using loops together. Help me code this challenge using a loop.”

  <iconp type='question'>How can I use a loop to code this challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the next line of code? </iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Why are loops a powerful tool for coders?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Encourage students to come to the conclusion that loops are powerful because they can shorten the number of lines of code they have to write or read through when there is a pattern in their code.</iconp>

#### 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Challenges (17 minutes)

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students work to complete challenges in playlist using loops.
Playlist consists of three types of challenges:
  - Read - Students read given code and paint the picture the code would produce.
  - Write - Students use code to move a bot to paint a given image.
  - Debug - Students are given code to fix to paint a given image.
 >>“Now that we’ve learned about loops, let’s practice reading, writing, and debugging code using loops.”

- [ ] **Circulate** and ask students questions on the challenge they are currently working on.
  - What does that code with that loop do?
  - How did you know to use a loop there?


#### 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (10 minutes)

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students work independently to write a program using loops to complete the Exit Challenge on the [Emoji | L4 playlist][playlist].
  >>“Okay coders, I have a challenge for you. *pause for students’ response*   Use loops to complete the Exit Challenge at the end of the playlist. You will work on this challenge independently to show me and yourself what you learned this lesson.”

- [ ] **Evaluate:** Circulate and check code to determine students’ understanding of writing a loop in PixelBots to paint a picture. If students complete the exit challenge early, they can continue to work on the PixelBots challenges from the playlist.
