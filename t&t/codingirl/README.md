# Coding IRL
Coding IRL teaches students text-based coding using HTML and CSS. Students start by exploring real world applications of coding, then move into learning the basics of HTML and CSS in order to structure and style their own websites. Students will use what they learn to personalize their websites, give each other feedback and revise their work before presenting to their peers in a culminating showcase.

## Purpose
Empower students to use computational thinking practices to analyze problems, build solutions, and be creative.


## Big Goals
  1. Students will apply core computational thinking concepts (algorithms, pattern recognition, control, and abstraction) to problem solving.
  1. Students will be fluent in reading, writing, and debugging code.


## Understandings
  1. Programs are built iteratively through a cycle of planning, writing, and checking.
  1. When code doesn’t work the way we want it to, we fearlessly, creatively, and systematically debug it.


## Essential questions
  1. What is the process of writing a program?
  1. When your program doesn’t do what you expected, how do you fix it?


## Lessons

Title | Description | Objective
---|---| ---
[Lesson 01: Coding IRL][1] |In Lesson 1 students learn about the greater applications of coding in the real world. Students discuss where they see examples of code in their own lives, and then have the chance to explore code and change content on internet using an online tool. The lesson closes with a debrief in which students discuss what they changed and how they used code to make those changes.|I can identify how code is used in the real world.
[Lesson 02: HTML][2] |In Lesson 2 students learn about the basics of writing HTML and creating the framework for their website. Students will see example web pages, complete a scavenger hunt on the new platform Thimble, and then they will start structuring their own website. The lesson closes with students sharing what they want to add to their website next class.|I can use HTML tags to structure my webpage.
[Lesson 03: HTML II][3] |In Lesson 3 students learn how to add images and links to make their websites more engaging and informative. Students identify the code that adds images and links, then they will be shown how to include their own. The lesson closes with students participating in a gallery walk and ask their peers questions about their website.|I can use HTML to add images and links to my webpage.
[Lesson 04: CSS][4] |In Lesson 4 students learn how to change the font color and background color of their webpage. Students identify the code that changes the elements on their webpage, then they will try it on their own. The lesson closes with students participating in a mix, freeze, pair and ask their peers questions about how they debugged their webpage.|I can use CSS to style the elements on my webpage.
[Lesson 05: Revise][5] |In Lesson 5 students practice taking feedback and revising their webpage. Students design and code a webpage that represents who they are. Students work in small groups to receive feedback from their peers, and then revise their code based on the feedback that is given. The webpage from this lesson is used in the project showcase in Lesson 6.|I can create a personalized webpage. I can revise my code based on feedback from my peers.
[Lesson 06: Showcase][6] |In Lesson 6 students showcase their webpage. Students use the first part of the lesson to complete their revisions and prepare to present their webpage to the group. The class then breaks off into small groups of 4-5 students with 1 instructor to share their webpage. The lesson concludes with a gallery walk in which students share positive praise for each using “praise post-its”.|I can showcase my webpage.
